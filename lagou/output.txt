 is a field of study that applies the principles of This field of endeavor is not limited to some traditional understandings of the relationship between materials and information. Some more narrow interpretations include The concept of materials informatics is addressed by the The editors focus on a limited definition of materials informatics, "the application of computational methodologies to processing and interpreting scientific and engineering data concerning materials."  They state that "specialized informatics tools for data capture, management, analysis, and dissemination" and "advances in computing power, coupled with computational modeling and simulation and materials properties databases" will enable such accelerated insertion of materials.
This view is not universally held. A broader definition goes beyond the use of computational methods to carry out the same experimentation.While there are many that believe in the future of informatics in the materials development and scaling process, many challenges remain. Hill, et. al., write that  "Today, the materials community faces serious challenges to bringing about this data-accelerated research paradigm, including diversity of research areas within materials, lack of data standards, and missing incentives for sharing, among others. Nonetheless, the landscape is rapidly changing in ways that should benefit the entire materials research enterprise."The overarching goals of bioinformatics and systems biology may provide a useful analogy.

Where am I?There is great demand in the industry for designing new materials, driven by stricter technical requirements and amended economic and legal framework conditions. As a result, new materials need to have tailored physical properties and be compatible with existing production processes. Furthermore, they should be based on cheap raw materials and only contain a few - or ideally zero - critical elements. Dependence on fluctuating raw material prices and delivery monopolies should also be reduced. Jump to: Dr. Daniel Urban The development of new materials in principle faces the needs of expensive and time-consuming experimental synthesis. At this point, a computational high-throughput screening approach is employed to speed up the development of novel materials. New simulation methods and growing computer capacities allow for a large number of structures and compositions to be virtually generated and predictions of their properties to be made. A large variety of options can be tested systematically and acted out in an efficient manner. The basis for this is a database in which the theoretical materials are stored. Data analysis algorithms make use of this database in order to adjust and improve the search direction on a permanent basis. Materials with promising properties can then subsequently be investigated in more detail and in a second step be experimentally synthesized. Machine learning offers further options to virtually detect new, attractive material structures. The large quantities of data generated by the computational high-throughput screening are post-processed using data mining algorithms. As a result, we extract the relations between crystal structures and composition (input) and physical properties (output) in the constantly growing IWM material library. We use this knowledge to uncover general trends and to find new phases with desired properties. Group Manager

We are developing a new capability that will allow efficient scaling and production of advanced materials by integrating automated information extraction, machine learning, data analytics, and experimental-materials synthesis and characterization. This research could lead to discovery of new synthesis processes with applications in weapon systems, energy, and climate research.The importance of discovery of novel materials has recently been emphasized with the launching of the Materials Genome Initiative by the White House in 2011. The goal of the initiative is to deploy advanced materials twice as fast and at a fraction of the cost by integrating computational and experimental tools, digital data, and collaborative networks. New materials with unique properties are synthesized every year by researchers around the globe. However, advanced materials produced with discovery research and development often do not transition to industry for application integration, partly because of scaling the synthesis process to the large-scale quantities required by industry. One reason why an experimentalist cannot reproduce high-quality materials at the larger scale is because of a lack of understanding of the critical reaction parameters involved in the synthesis. In a given synthesis of a material, there are a number of reaction parameters, including specific chemicals, chemical concentrations, temperatures, additives, reaction times, and solvents, just to name a few. It is often difficult and time consuming to experimentally pinpoint the most important parameters to obtain the desired results. If we can discover and validate the most relevant critical reaction parameters from existing literature using computational and data-processing techniques, we will have made a significant leap in the field of materials synthesis and informatics. We will explore how to successfully transition academic research and development processes to pre-pilot plant scales by understanding the fundamental principles in materials synthesis. We will do this by extracting and experimentally verifying correlations between processing, structure, and function in the existing literature by integrating automated information extraction, machine learning, data analytics, and experimental materials synthesis and characterization (see Figure 1).We will leverage Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's expertise in advanced materials synthesis and computational processes to develop a new capability that will enable efficient scaling and production of advanced materials to meet current and future demands. For example, we intend to address solution-based synthesis of metal, metal oxides, and magnetic materials. More specifically, we will address the shape and size evolution of these materials from the nanometer to micrometer scales. Transitioning a synthesis from a small to a larger scale is often difficult because of the precipitous drop in the quality of the materials as the scale of synthesis increases. Our research effort will provide a science-based material-synthesis approach to scale up high-quality materials from a wealth of small-scale materials synthesis literature, which will have a significant impact in numerous applications. In particular, we expect to develop information- and observation-driven processes to synthesize materials with high quality and quantity to meet the demands of both the internal and external community. Our research may also lead to discovery of new synthesis processes that have yet to be explored.Our research effort will enhance current Laboratory capabilities in the core competency of advanced materials and manufacturing by addressing our limited capability to synthesize large quantities of advanced materials to supply multiple programs and external commercial and government entities. This research also supports the DOE goal to transform our understanding of nature and strengthen the connection between advances in fundamental science and technology innovation. Material we generate can impact several mission-focus areas, including stockpile stewardship science with materials relevant to weapon systems, energy security with magnetic materials to improve energy applications, and inertial fusion science and technology with materials relevant to laser target development. Computational and informatics processes we will develop support the core competency in high-performance computing, simulation, and data science.In FY17 we (1) successfully demonstrated machine-learning algorithms for extraction of experimental sections, chemical entities, and images; (2) established a web-crawl process to capture documents pertaining to materials synthesis, and began performing analysis of extracted entities; and (3) evaluated various synthesis platforms to rapidly screen many reaction conditions learned from automated information extraction and data analyses to quickly use captured information for the production of high-quality materials.Han,T. 2016.

The rubber materials of tires contain nano-scale fillers e.g. carbon black and silica for the improvement of tire performances e.g. rolling resistance, wear and so on. The mechanical properties of filled rubber depend on the morphology i.e. topology of microstructure. It is said that uniformly dispersed fillers are good for reduction of loss tangent, however, guideline of material design to improve loss tangent, modulus and strength at the same time is not clear. Therefore, we conduct the research to find design guideline for filled rubbers based on materials informatics. In this presentation, the application focusing on morphology of filled rubbers is demonstrated. In our research the following methods are used; the multi-scale random model based on Poisson point process, FFT-based scheme for the large-scale numerical simulation to compute objective functions, evolutional computation, self-organizing map and machine learning. The design variables e.g. Poisson point intensity, radius and volume fraction change the morphology of representative volume element (RVE). The objective functions are loss tangent, modulus and stress of RVE. NSGA-II is used to prepare data set including approximate Pareto solution for machine learning. After clustering by self-organizing map, machine learning generates a classification rules using the data set labeled with cluster number. The following design guidelines were found from the classification rules; the filler radius should be small, the boundary layer between filler and polymer should be thin. Currently, we are developing new rubber materials based on the obtained guidelines.

NAOYA KOWATARI is a computer scientist at Yokohama Rubber Co., Ltd. He received his M.E. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Shinshu University in 2011. He studied Multiobjective Optimization Algorithms. He applies computer science and data science to tire design optimization problem concerning material and structure. Recently his main research interest is machine-learning with big data that is not yet used efficiently in his company.

Open Access is an initiative that aims to make scientific research freely available to all. To date our community has made over 100 million downloads. It’s based on principles of collaboration, unobstructed discovery, and, most importantly, scientific progression. As PhD students, we found it difficult to access the research we needed, so we decided to create a new Open Access publisher that levels the playing field for scientists across the world. How? By making research easy to access, and puts the academic needs of the researchers before the business interests of publishers.We are a community of more than 103,000 authors and editors from 3,291 institutions spanning 160 countries, including Nobel Prize winners and some of the world’s most-cited researchers. Publishing on IntechOpen allows authors to earn citations and find new collaborators, meaning more people see your work not only from your own field of study, but from other related fields too.Brief introduction to this section that descibes Open Access especially from an IntechOpen perspectiveWant to get in touch?

February 21st, 2017 02/21/2017 Dr. Taylor D. SparksAssistant ProfessorMaterials Science & EngineeringUniversity of Utah The Role of Big Data and Materials Informatics in Accelerating New Materials DiscoveryOver 6 years ago the White House announced the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) asking computational materials scientists and experimentalists to find ways to “discover, develop, manufacture, and deploy materials twice as fast at a fraction of the cost.” High throughput computation and experiments have made some progress but we are still far from the MGI goal. However, the emerging field of Materials Informatics offers a completely new and under-utilized approach via machine learning for materials problems. In this talk I’ll present some of the new data-driven tools we are developing with Citrine Informatics such as the “Materials Recommendation Engine” to reduce the risk associated with exploring chemical whitespace for new, interesting materials. Using this new tool we explore novel new thermoelectric compositions and present validation for the model using leave-one-out cross validation of a large database of known materials. We also synthesize and characterize an entirely new material, REDr. Sparks joined the Materials Science and Engineering Department at the University of Utah as an Assistant Professor in 2013. He is originally from Utah and an alumni of the department he now teaches in. Before graduate school he worked at Ceramatec Inc. on geopolymers, reaction bonded ceramics, and fuel cell insulation.

 Artificial intelligence (AI) can be defined as a combination of data mining, machine learning, and statistical methods. The combination of these methods in materials science is gaining traction to satisfy industry demands for more efficient materials discovery, development, and commercialization. AI in advanced materials research and development is the logical next step in information generation after experiment, theory, and simulation. However, the problem with implementing AI has many facets, as described in a Despite materials informatics receiving Innovation managers, researchers, and professors alike will have to wait patiently for the ultimate Advanced Materials prediction platform, but those willing to compromise on this vision of a comprehensive prediction platform may see the beginnings of data-driven platforms that support the materials innovation pipeline. Companies like IBM, Nutonian, Enterra Solutions, and Citrine Informatics all tout AI, industrialized data science, big data analytics, and machine learning as they aim to deliver materials informatics to Innovation 1000 companies. The differentiator between these players will be the development of automated data collection and organization methods, such as machine vision, which mine relevant data sets and enable consistently successful AI predictions – something clients should keep in mind as they evaluate early-stage partnerships.Innovation PortalsCII DivisionsCorporate InformationFor the latest news on Enterprise AI, AI research, AI webinars, AI World conference discounts and more!

Inspire | Innovate | Inform | Imbibe | ImproveA few weeks ago, a colleague asked me - “How Machine Learning is Applicable in Material Science?”. It got me interested, because these are two topics, I understand very well. We both studied Computational Material Science (Material Informatics), utilized python and other tools to build models, evaluated terabytes of data from simulations, used statistical mechanics and numerical methods to extract useful insights on the structure-property relationships of material. Indeed, machine learning methods sound familiar to a computational material scientist, but it is an elusive familiarity.  In this blog, I will examine areas in which machine learning and material science intertwine.Propelled by Machine learning automates analytical model building, using algorithms that iteratively learn from data, allowing computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed. Much has been written about machine learning and how our daily activities; web searches, credit scoring, fraud detection, and text analysis amongst others influenced by this field.In material science, machine learning is critical in areas such as new materials discovery and material property prediction. For example, in an experiment on predicting the glass transition temperature Tg it is difficult to find a formula that can accurately describe the relationship between Tg and the four relevant factors of rigidness, chain mobility, average molecular polarizability and net charge; however, a machine learning method can be used to model the relationships between conditional factors and decision attributes based on a given sample. This is where machine learning plays a role and where the “core” algorithms lie. The knowledge obtained through machine learning is stored in a format that is readily usable and, in turn, can be used for materials discovery and design.Basic steps of machine learning in material science, involves three steps, sample generation, module building and model evaluations
Regardless of the problem under study, a criterion for machine learning is existence of past data, either clean, curated and reliable data corresponding to the problem under study should already be available, or an effort is in place for the creation of the data.In material science, a machine learning framework for predicting material properties, includes a dataset with attributes relating to a variety of materials that fall within a  chemical class of interest, and a relevant measured or computed property of those materials i.e., the material, is referred to as “input”, and the property of interest, is referred to as the “target” or “output.”  Thus, the learning problem is then defined as follows: 
Given a {materials → property} dataset, what is the best estimate of the property for a new material not in the original dataset?An approach to understanding this problem, is to first represent numerically the various input cases (or materials) in the dataset. Each input case would have been reduced to a string of numbers, it is important to emphasize this step, because this is where one requires significant expertise and knowledge of the materials class and the application (‘domain expertise”).
The second step establishes a mapping between the features and the target property, and is entirely numerical in nature, largely devoid of the need for domain knowledge. Both the fingerprinting and mapping/learning steps are schematically.
Several algorithms, ranging from simple (e.g., linear regression) to highly sophisticated (kernel ridge 4 regression, decision trees, deep neural networks), are available to establish this mapping and the creation of surrogate prediction models. While some algorithms provide actual functional forms that relate input to output (e.g., regression), others do not (e.g., decision trees).In this discussion, the assumption is that the target property is a continuous quantity (e.g., bulk modulus, band gap, melting temperature, etc.). Problems can also involve discrete targets (e.g., crystal structure, specific structural motifs, etc.), which are referred to as classification problems.  Throughout the machine learning process, it is essential to adhere to rigorous statistical practices. Central to this is the notion of cross-validation and testing on unseen data, which attempt to ensure that a learning model developed based on the original dataset can truly handle a new case without falling prey to the perils of “overfitting”.The materials science community is just beginning to explore and utilize the plethora of available information theoretic algorithms to mine and learn from data. Machine learning should be viewed as the sum total of the organized creation of the initial dataset, the fingerprinting and learning steps, and a necessary subsequent step (discussed at the end of this article) of progressive and targeted new data infusion, ultimately leading to an expert recommendation system that can continuously and adaptively improve.

    Fujitsu Limited and RIKEN today announced that the RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP) and the RIKEN AIP-Fujitsu Collaboration CenterWith this method, even if only a comparatively small amount of data could be obtained from the first principles calculation, which carries a significant computational load, by combining this data with AI methods, the researchers can efficiently find an optimal material composition and accelerate materials development. Going forward, there are high expectations for the utilization of materials informaticsSuccess in materials development has until now relied on the years of experience and keen insights of researchers and technicians. Also unavoidable was a lengthy list of failures.On the other hand, first principles calculation can predict the characteristics of a specified material based on quantum mechanics, so it can predict the optimal composition of a new high-functionality material in advance of any experiments, which is useful in reducing the number of failed experiments. Because the computational load of such calculation is extremely large, however, when numerous computations for a variety of compositions were conducted at once, it could take up an enormous amount of time just to complete the computations. The RIKEN AIP-Fujitsu Collaboration Center has been conducting research and development centered on the theme of "AI that predicts the unpredictable." As part of this theme, the group aims to resolve issues in materials development through a close collaboration between materials simulation, experiments and AI, achieving such results as shortening development times to a fraction of what they have been. Furthermore, the group is making efforts to discover new high-functionality materials with compositions or crystal structures that are difficult to think up. Researchers are now able to limit the number of first principles calculations to a fraction of what would have previously been needed by combining it with Bayesian inference method
Lithium ionic conductivity is an important characteristic of solid electrolyte materials, as it is the factor that controls the speed at which a lithium battery charges and discharges. The results of this trial show that material informatics technology utilizing both materials simulation and AI methods is an effective tool in the efficient development of lithium-ion batteries with excellent charging and discharging characteristics, without the risk of leakage or ignition.Fujitsu and RIKEN will continue to promote the advanced use of AI in materials development, working to further establish materials informatics technology that can be applied to a variety of materials. In addition, through the application of these technologies, the organizations will contribute to the efficient development of new materials.

We have enjoyed a century of innovation and productivity since Henry Ford and the Ford Motor Company developed the assembly line manufacturing process over the years of 1908 to 1915. While originally proposed by Adam Smith in his work The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, Ford popularized the method of progressive assembly in which interchangeable parts and laborers constructed a product using a sequential process that had been optimized for efficiency. Total per car assembly time for the venerable Model-T was reduced from 12.5 hours to 93 minutes in a dynamic production line that generated a finished automobile every three minutes. While amazingly efficient, Ford’s assembly line was also amazingly inflexible. “Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black,” is a famous stance recalled by Ford in his autobiography — efficiency and optimization did not easily accommodate customization and innovation.Alfred P. Sloan addressed this deficiency as President and later Chairman of the Board of General Motors from 1923 to 1956. He separated the production line into divisions, such as engine, powertrain and body, and charged them with incorporating annual styling changes into GM’s assembly line in a process that evolved into the concept of “planned obsolescence,” an approach that designs a product with a limited useful life or style. This method infused customization and innovation into upcoming model years; however, it still took several years to research, develop and retool the assembly line in a process that pushed the model year currently under study several years into the future.The 1980s also saw the rise of computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) software that permitted these teams to experiment with new designs in software, obviating the need to build scale prototypes for each proposed design modification. Castaing is credited with the modern-day success of the sport utility vehicle (SUV) and, after the acquisition of AMC by Chrysler in 1987, his design teams were credited with development of the LH-platform used by the Eagle Vision, Dodge Intrepid, Chrysler Concorde, LHS and New Yorker, all of which could be designed from concept to production in 39 months instead of the normal 50 months required by traditional divisional design approaches. This progression from Ford, through Sloan, to Castaing continues today. Large, complex systems are broken down into smaller, more manageable components that permit rapid development and experimentation. As components continue to shrink in scope and size, statistical information of system variables is replaced by volumes of information that is specific to individual parts and materials, ultimately arriving at details on the level of atoms and molecules. The rise of material informatics is experiencing challenges and opportunities similar to those arising from the development of medical-, chemo- and bioinformatics. June 2011 saw the creation of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) by the National Science and Technology Council. Dr. John P. Holdren, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology introduces the initiative by writing:At its heart, the MGI seeks the development of a “new integrated design continuum that incorporates the greater use of computing and information technologies coupled with advances in characterization and experiment” and seeks to shorten the materials development cycle from its current 10 to 20 years to two or three years. The MGI suggests an approach that includes:While a similar progression evolved over a century in automobile manufacturing, the Human Genome Project was accomplished in the 10 years between 1990 and 2000. Leveraging the lessons learned in these two examples and the continued advancement in software and computing technology, the rise of materials informatics may be a rapid one.  + Expand for more information.© Copyright 2018 Advantage Business Marketing- CollapseNote: If you are using a browser that is not listed here, please do a quick internet search on how to block cookies and tracking for your specific browser.This website uses cookies to ensure you get the best user experience.

The rapid rise of novel single-layer materials presents the exciting opportunity for materials science to explore an entirely new class of materials. This comes at the time when mature computational methods provide the predictive capability to enable the computational discovery, characterization, and design of single-layer materials and provide the needed input and guidance to experimental studies. I will present our data-mining, chemical substitution, and evolutionary algorithm approaches to identify novel 2D materials with low formation energies and show how unexpected structures emerge when a material is reduced to sub-nanometers in thickness. To identify 2D materials that can be synthesized by exfoliation of bulk materials, we searched the Materials Project crystal structure database for materials possessing layered motifs in their crystal structures using a topology-scaling algorithm. The algorithm identifies and measures the sizes of bonded atomic clusters in a structure’s unit cell, and determines their scaling with cell size. The search yielded 680 monolayers with exfoliation energies below those of already-existent 2D materials. These materials guide future experimental synthesis efforts. Among the 2D materials, we find that for several 2D transition-metal chalcogenide compounds ferromagnetic order emerges at temperatures accessible to experiments. Calculations of the magnetic anisotropy show that many of the magnetic 2D materials exhibit an easy-plane for the magnetic moment and hence a Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition to a magnetically ordered low-temperature phase. A few 2D materials display an easy magnetization axis and thus an actual ferromagnetic ground state. Furthermore, we identify a family of three magnetic 2D materials with half-metallic band structures. Their purely spin-polarized currents and dispersive interlayer interactions should make these materials useful for 2D spin valves and other spintronic applications. These new 2D materials provide the opportunity to investigate the interplay of magnetic order and reduced dimensionality and may provide materials suitable for optoelectronic and spintronic applications. The structures and other calculated data for all 2D materials are available in the MaterialsWeb database at

Designing novel materials with the desired physical and chemical properties is recognized as an outstanding problem in materials research. This problem is extremely challenging because materials’ properties depend on a large number of variables such as constitutive elements, crystal forms, and geometrical or electronic characteristics. Traditionally, computational design of materials has been accomplished by means of quantum mechanical and simulations approaches. However, rapid growth of material research has led to the accumulation of a huge body of empirical data on crystal structures and properties of materials stored in specialized databases. These developments create new opportunities to explore the materials knowledge base using statistical and data mining approaches and enable further development and enhancement of the nascent field of materials informatics. We develop and deploy, ultimately in the form of user-friendly software, novel materials informatics approaches and computational tools to empower material scientists with efficient technologies for analyzing, modeling, and imputing properties of materials. These tools will enable:

Theoretical and computational chemistry have contributed to a better understanding of the mechanisms and efficient molecular design for catalytic systems and functional materials. For the next challenge, we aim to devise a new research area by combining theoretical chemistry and informatics technology. Recently, along with the development of automated reaction path search methods, it has become possible to obtain big chunks of data regarding reaction pathways. Based on this data, we will extract the keys to determining reactivity and catalytic ability from a different viewpoint obtained by utilizing informatics technology, including machine learning and deep learning. Our material informatics strategy is applicable not only to chemical reaction systems but also to various functional materials. By using this strategy, we aim to construct a new methodology to accelerate the development of new functional materials.We explore the catalytic reaction pathways exhaustively by using a recently developed automated reaction path search method, called the Global Reaction Route Mapping (GRRM) strategy. This strategy gathers all the important intermediates and transition states automatically, which enables us to discuss the regio- and stereo-selectivity as well as reaction mechanism.Lanthanide materials are widely used for display, optical fibers, in vivo probes and sensors. To understand the mechanisms and predict the luminescent properties of these materials, we study the potential energy surfaces of ground and excited states using our unique approximation method.The GRRM is very powerful tool to gather information about chemical reactions. However, it becomes difficult to analyze the calculation results because of a surplus of data in the intermediate and transition states. To analyze the data efficiently, we apply informatics techniques and aim to accelerate computational research.1.　N.Hayakawa, K. Sadamori, S. Tsujimoto, M. Hatanaka, T. Wakabayashi, T.

Credit: Sam Million-Weaver.Materials science is at the beginning of major transformation driven by the integration of data science and machine learning technologies. This integration is creating the new field of materials informatics, which applies computational and machine learning tools to characterizing and discovering materials. To efficiently realize the full potential of materials informatics, it is essential to educate today’s students in this novel and interdisciplinary area. That’s just one reason why a newly expanded summer fellowship in materials informatics presents such an exciting opportunity for a group of University of Wisconsin-Madison engineering undergrads.The With a $400,000 commitment from Schmidt Futures, Citrine Informatics is sponsoring the fellows from UW-Madison and several other institutions. A relatively young Silicon Valley startup, Citrine was founded in 2014 to accelerate the development and use of new materials by harnessing the power of machine learning principles. Citrine and other materials informatics efforts have blossomed since the Material Genome Initiative—a public-private research partnership to integrate digital technologies into materials development—was announced in 2011. Citrine sees the academic community as a crucial partner is this endeavor, says the startup’s community manager, Josh Tappan.“One thing we’ve noticed is that for us to promote materials informatics, we need to show students what it is and how to apply it,” says Tappan.To that end, Citrine self-funded a pilot fellowship in 2017, which paid four undergraduate fellows to conduct research while learning and utilizing the tools of the trade. One of those four was UW-Madison Through the course of the summer, Nilsen remained in Madison and met regularly on campus with faculty mentor Professor “I had a great experience with the fellowship,” says Nilsen. “One of the best aspects of it for me personally was that I feel confident that I could have a career after I graduate in a field where I fit and with people who I fit in with. I made great connections through the fellowship.” Those connections have endured, as Nilsen has remained in touch with Citrine as she develops a standalone course for training in materials informatics and mentors half a dozen other students in the subject.For his part, Morgan is excited to see the Citrine NextGen Fellowship program grow and fund even more UW-Madison undergrads this year.“Watching from the outside, it seems to me that this fellowship has been a foundational experience in Vanessa’s education,” Morgan says. “It’s given her a level of expertise and confidence in this area, and she’s since led training efforts in the Skunkworks group. I see a direct impact of the fellowship experience. I am looking forward to many such transformative experiences for other participants.”This year, fellows from UW-Madison will join students from Carnegie Mellon University, Colorado School of Mines, North Carolina State University and Texas A&M University, which will allow them to interact not only with local peers and colleagues at Citrine but to get a sense of the inter-institutional collaborations that are common in higher education. Morgan says the local fellows will focus on developing tools that automate the analysis of images that are taken in materials science experiments. It’s an important problem to solve, Morgan says.“Many tools of materials characterization are becoming so much faster and more powerful that they generate data on a scale that is outstripping our human ability to analyze it,” says Morgan. “We want to train machine vision tools to recognize features in image data automatically.”The fellows at UW Madison will also be participants in the Author:

The data driven paradigm for materials discovery needs to explore a much bigger dimensional feature space in data which includes issues such as uncertainty, skewness, sparseness and the diverse and numerous forms of data including numerical, textual, conceptual and imaging. The integration of all these different modalities and attributes of data, along with volume, is what Materials Informatics is really about.If enhancing data volume is an important but not sufficient criterion for informatics, then where in fact should the field of Materials Informatics be headed? The answer to that lies in harnessing the paradigm of “Big Data”; where the word “big” refers to the size of the dimensionality of correlations to explore in analyzing data driven problems, of which volume of data is just one aspect. The broader information science community has appropriately defined Big Data as governed by four metrics: volume, velocity, variety and veracity. The “4Data volume of course we readily understand. Data velocity refers to harnessing real time data acquisition (e.g., data from dynamics experiments). Data variety is concerned with the fact that data takes all forms in materials science, ranging from discrete numerical values to qualitative descriptions of materials behavior and imaging data. Veracity, the final Finally, we need to reiterate that our ultimate goal for Materials Informatics is to discover new knowledge.

In particular, current approaches to the development and insertion (deployment) of advanced materials in military systems are too time-intensive and expensive. Despite the large investments in defense systems, insertion is not certain, since materials development is often not linked to the system designer needs, with the results frequently being that the materials do not meet their requirements. There is potentially a high payoff for developing methodologies that will accelerate the insertion of materials, thereby saving millions of investment dollars. All industries engaged in developing advanced materials are searching for new methodologies to solve these problems.Once a new material has been developed, it must be characterized and modeled. Otherwise, components using it cannot be analyzed, and consequently, it cannot be used in engineering products. Therefore, exploiting the full benefits of new (and existing) engineering materials requires specialized informatics tools for data capture, management, analysis, and dissemination. Advances in computing power, coupled with computational modeling and simulation and materials properties databases, will enable materials scientists and engineers to meet these challenges.The articles in this issue of The prediction of crystal structure is a key outstanding problem in materials science and one that is fundamental to computational materials design. We argue that by combining the predictive accuracy of quantum mechanics with data mining tools to extract knowledge from a large body of historical experimental or computational results, this problem can be successfully addressed.We describe some recent advances in the methodology of using electronic structure calculations for materials design. The methods have been developed for the design of ordered metallic alloys and metal alloy catalysts, but the considerations we present are relevant for the atomic-scale computational design of other materials as well. A central problem is how to treat the huge number of compounds that can be envisioned by varying the concentrations and the number of the elements involved. We discuss various strategies for approaching this problem and show how one strategy has led to the computational discovery of a promising catalytic metal alloy surface with high reactivity and low cost.Data mining of crystal structure databases is performed with methods using deduction, semiempirical heuristic principles, or artificial intelligence to create new information from crystal structure data. In this article, enlightening examples, ranging from a systematic search for new ferroelectric materials to ultrahard, ductile, or high-dielectric-permittivity materials, are detailed, with numerous references providing a handle on the state of the art. This activity is just leaving infancy, especially for its ab initio aspects, with the brightest future ahead. Data mining will clearly guide expensive experiments through inexpensive computations for decades to come. This perspective greatly enhances the value of structure data patiently archived within crystal structure databases for nearly a century now.To cope with the dynamic social and market demands for advanced materials, new research strategies have to be developed that go beyond the commonly accepted trial-and-error approaches. To this end, a computational materials design platform, digital materials design (DMD), has been created based on well-established fundamental laws, powerful computing, and computational technology. DMD based on computer simulation may produce data that identify overlooked materials behaviors, which then may lead to new theory to explain them, and further to the design of real experiments to fabricate and test the materials. In this review, an illustration of computational methods used in DMD will be given, followed by applications based on two case studies: (1) the design of chemical additives, and (2) the realization of High-throughput experimentation is effective in systematically producing large and diverse data sets. The marriage of combinatorial materials science and informatics is a natural one, and results are beginning to emerge from the integration of elements of materials informatics with data from combinatorial libraries. We discuss data management issues in high-throughput experimentation and highlight recent examples where data-mining tools are being implemented for extracting knowledge and predicting new compounds, with an emphasis on electronic materials.This article discusses the need for materials data and materials data management software during product development. Key issues are the changing materials data needs (from general to specific) as the design process proceeds, as well as the requirements for software systems that can automate the key data management tasks: capture, analysis, deployment, and maintenance. Specific issues requiring attention are flexibility of data management, change control, version control, quality control, and traceability of information.Materials property information such as composition and thermophysical/mechanical properties abound in the literature. Oftentimes, however, the corresponding response curves from which these data are determined are missing or at the very least difficult to retrieve. Further, the paradigm for collecting materials property information has historically centered on (1) properties for materials comparison/selection purposes and (2) input requirements for conventional design/analysis methods. However, just as not all materials are alike or equal, neither are all constitutive models (and thus design/analysis methods) equal; each model typically has its own specific and often unique required materials parameters, some directly measurable and others indirectly measurable. Therefore, the type and extent of materials information routinely collected is not always sufficient to meet the current, much less future, needs of the materials modeling community. has been defined as the science concerned with gathering, manipulating, storing, retrieving, and classifying recorded information. A key aspect of informatics is its focus on understanding problems and applying information technology as needed to address those problems. The primary objective of this article is to highlight the need for a paradigm shift in materials data collection, analysis, and dissemination so as to maximize the impact on both practitioners and researchers. Our hope is to identify and articulate what constitutes “sufficient” data content (i.e., quality and quantity) for developing, characterizing, and validating sophisticated nonlinear time- and history-dependent (hereditary) constitutive models. Likewise, the informatics infrastructure required for handling the potentially massive amounts of materials data will be discussed.Copy and paste a formatted citation or use one of the options to export in your chosen format

The work in the Horizontal Project 5, The goal of HP5 is to develop data driven methodologies for the acceleration of material discovery. The scientific community has been generating enormous amounts of valuable knowledge that has mostly remained confined into papers. Recently, it became evident that the data driven approach can unlock the huge potential of this data and allow for drastic acceleration of discovery. Indeed, HP5 researchers demonstrated that machine learning models can provide very accurate predictions of materials properties at a fraction of the cost and time needed by traditional approaches. Extracting the scientific literature treasure and structuring into searchable forms allow researchers to very fast learn from the collective experience of the community and thus move forward much faster. This is of course only the beginning. We have merely scratched the surface and already gotten strong evidence of the full potential of the approach.

 Krishna RajanDepartment of Materials Design and Innovation, University at Buffalo, State University of New York, Buffalo, New York 14260; email: Materials informatics provides the foundations for a new paradigm of materials discovery. It shifts our emphasis from one of solely searching among large volumes of data that may be generated by experiment or computation to one of targeted materials discovery via high-throughput identification of the key factors (i.e., “genes”) and via showing how these factors can be quantitatively integrated by statistical learning methods into design rules (i.e., “gene sequencing”) governing targeted materials functionality. However, a critical challenge in discovering these materials genes is the difficulty in unraveling the complexity of the data associated with numerous factors including noise, uncertainty, and the complex diversity of data that one needs to consider (i.e., Big Data). In this article, we explore one aspect of materials informatics, namely how one can efficiently explore for new knowledge in regimes of structure-property space, especially when no reasonable selection pathways based on theory or clear trends in observations exist among an almost infinite set of possibilities.

:  In this age of "big data," large-scale experimental and simulation data are increasingly becoming available in all fields of science, and materials science is no exception. Our ability to collect and store these data has greatly surpassed our capability to analyze it, underscoring the emergence of the fourth paradigm of science, which is data-driven discovery. The need to use advanced data science approaches in materials science is also recognized by the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI), further promoting the emerging field of materials informatics.In this talk, I will present some of our recent work employing state-of-the-art data analytics, including deep learning for exploring processing-structure-property-performance (PSPP) linkages in materials, both in terms of forward models (e.g., predicting property for a given material) and inverse models (e.g., discovering materials that possess a desired property). Examples of forward models include predicting mechanical properties such as fatigue strength and microscale strain distribution, thermodynamic properties such as stability, and thermoelectric properties such as the Seebeck coefficient. Examples of inverse models include discovery of stable compounds, indexing electron back-scatter diffraction patterns, and microstructure optimization of a magnetostrictive Fe-Ga alloy.I will also demonstrate some online web tools we have developed that deploy machine learning models to predict materials properties. Such data-driven analytics can significantly accelerate prediction of material properties, which in turn can accelerate the optimization process and thus help realize the dream of rational materials design. The increasingly availability of materials databases along with groundbreaking advances in data science approaches offers lot of promise to successfully realize the goals of MGI, and aid in the discovery, design, and deployment of next-generation materials.

AdvertisementMaterials informatics employs techniques, tools, and theories drawn from the emerging fields of data science, internet, computer science and engineering, and digital technologies to the materials science and engineering to accelerate materials, products and manufacturing innovations. Manufacturing is transforming into shorter design cycles, mass customization, on-demand production, and sustainable products. Additive manufacturing or 3D printing is a popular example of such a trend. However, the success of this manufacturing transformation is critically dependent on the availability of suitable materials and of data on invertible processing–structure–property–performance life cycle linkages of materials. Experience suggests that the material development cycle, i.e. the time to develop and deploy new material, generally exceeds the product design and development cycle. Hence, there is a need to accelerate materials innovation in order to keep up with product and manufacturing innovations. This is a major challenge considering the hundreds of thousands of materials and processes, and the huge amount of data on microstructure, composition, properties, and functional, environmental, and economic performance of materials. Moreover, the data sharing culture among the materials community is sparse. Materials informatics is key to the necessary transformation in product design and manufacturing. Through the association of material and information sciences, the emerging field of materials informatics proposes to computationally mine and analyze large ensembles of experimental and modeling datasets efficiently and cost effectively and to deliver core materials knowledge in user-friendly ways to the designers of materials and products, and to the manufacturers. This paper reviews the various developments in materials informatics and how it facilitates materials innovation by way of specific examples.Seeram Ramakrishna acknowledges support from Lloyds Register Foundation Grant LRF WBS 265-000-553-597.

Generate a file for use with external citation management software.Material informatics is engaged with the application of informatic principles to materials science in order to assist in the discovery and development of new materials. Central to the field is the application of data mining techniques and in particular machine learning approaches, often referred to as Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling, to derive predictive models for a variety of materials-related "activities". Such models can accelerate the development of new materials with favorable properties and provide insight into the factors governing these properties. Here we provide a comparison between medicinal chemistry/drug design and materials-related QSAR modeling and highlight the importance of developing new, materials-specific descriptors. We survey some of the most recent QSAR models developed in materials science with focus on energetic materials and on solar cells. Finally we present new examples of material-informatic analyses of solar cells libraries produced from metal oxides using combinatorial material synthesis. Different analyses lead to interesting physical insights as well as to the design of new cells with potentially improved photovoltaic parameters.Material informatics; QSAR; chemoinformatics; material science; photovoltaic cells; solar cellsYour browsing activity is empty.Activity recording is turned off.

                                    , Article number: Propelled partly by the Materials Genome Initiative, and partly by the algorithmic developments and the resounding successes of data-driven efforts in other domains, informatics strategies are beginning to take shape within materials science. These approaches lead to surrogate machine learning models that enable rapid predictions based purely on past data rather than by direct experimentation or by computations/simulations in which fundamental equations are explicitly solved. Data-centric informatics methods are becoming useful to determine material properties that are hard to measure or compute using traditional methods—due to the cost, time or effort involved—but for which reliable data either already exists or can be generated for at least a subset of the critical cases. Predictions are typically interpolative, involving fingerprinting a material numerically first, and then following a mapping (established via a learning algorithm) between the fingerprint and the property of interest. Fingerprints, also referred to as “descriptors”, may be of many types and scales, as dictated by the application domain and needs. Predictions may also be extrapolative—extending into new materials spaces—provided prediction uncertainties are properly taken into account. This article attempts to provide an overview of some of the recent successful data-driven “materials informatics” strategies undertaken in the last decade, with particular emphasis on the fingerprint or descriptor choices. The review also identifies some challenges the community is facing and those that should be overcome in the near future.When a new situation is encountered, cognitive systems (including humans) have a natural tendency to make decisions based on past similar encounters. When the new situation is distinctly different from those encountered in the past, errors in judgment may occur and lessons may be learned. The sum total of such past scenarios, decisions made and the lessons learned may be viewed collectively as “experience”, “intuition” or even as “common sense”. Ideally, depending on the intrinsic capability of the cognitive system, its ability to make decisions should progressively improve as the richness of scenarios encountered increases.In recent decades, the artificial intelligence (AI) and statistics communities have made these seemingly vague notions quantitative and mathematically precise.On the surface, it may appear as though the “data-driven” approach for determining the best decision or answer when a new situation or problem is encountered is radically different from approaches based on fundamental science in which predictions are made by solving equations that govern the pertinent phenomena. But viewed differently, is not the scientific process itself—which begins with observations, followed by intuition, then construction of a quantitative theory that explains the observations, and subsequently, refinement of the theory based on new observations—the ultimate culmination of such data-driven inquiries?For instance, consider how the ancient people from India and Sri Lanka figured out, through persistent tinkering, the alloying elements to add to iron to impede its tendency to rust, using only their experience and creativitySome classic historical examples of data-driven science and engineering efforts
                     In more modern times, in the last decade or so, thanks to the implicit or explicit acceptance of the above notions, the “data-driven”, “machine learning”, or “materials informatics” paradigms (with these terms used interchangeably by the community) are rapidly becoming an essential part of the materials research portfolio.With excitement and opportunities come challenges. Questions constantly arise as to what sort of materials science problems are most appropriate for, or can benefit most from, a data-driven approach. A satisfactory understanding of this aspect is essential before one makes a decision on using machine learning methods for their problem of interest. Perhaps the most dangerous aspect of data-driven approaches is the unwitting application of machine learning models to cases that fall outside the domain of prior data. A rich and largely uncharted area of inquiry is to recognize when such a scenario ensues, and to be able to quantify the uncertainties of the machine learning predictions especially when models veer out-of-domain. Solutions for handling these perilous situations may open up pathways for adaptive learning models that can progressively improve in quality through systematic infusion of new data—an aspect critical to the further burgeoning of machine learning within the hard sciences.This article attempts to provide an overview of some of the recent successful data-driven materials research strategies undertaken in the last decade, and identifies challenges that the community is facing and those that should be overcome in the near future.Regardless of the specific problem under study, a prerequisite for machine learning is the existence of past data. Thus, either clean, curated and reliable data corresponding to the problem under study should already be available, or an effort has to be put in place upfront for the creation of such data. An example data set may be an enumeration of a variety of materials that fall within a well-defined chemical class of interest and a relevant measured or computed property of those materials (see Fig. The key elements of machine learning in materials science. 
                     All data-driven strategies that attempt to address the problem posed above are composed of two distinct steps, both aimed at satisfying the need for quantitative predictions. The first step is to represent numerically the various input cases (or materials) in the data set. At the end of this step, each input case would have been reduced to a string of numbers (or “fingerprints”; see Fig. The second step establishes a mapping between the fingerprinted input and the target property, and is entirely numerical in nature, largely devoid of the need for domain knowledge. Both the fingerprinting and mapping/learning steps are schematically illustrated in Fig. Throughout the learning process, it is typical (and essential) to adhere to rigorous statistical practices. Central to this are the notions of cross-validation and testing on unseen data, which attempt to ensure that a learning model developed based on the original data set can truly handle a new case without falling prey to the perils of “overfitting”.Machine learning should be viewed as the sum total of the organized creation of the initial data set, the fingerprinting and learning steps, and a necessary subsequent step (discussed at the end of this article) of progressive and targeted new data infusion, ultimately leading to an expert recommendation system that can continuously and adaptively improve.We now elaborate on what is perhaps the most important component of the machine learning paradigm, the one that deals with the numerical representation of the input cases or materials. A numerical representation is essential to make the prediction scheme quantitative (i.e., moving it away from the “vague” notions alluded to in the first paragraph of this article). The choice of the numerical representation can be effectively accomplished only with adequate knowledge of the problem and goals (i.e., domain expertise or experience), and typically proceeds in an iterative manner by duly considering aspects of the material that the target property may be correlated with. Given that the numerical representation serves as the proxy for the real material, it is also referred to as the fingerprint of the material or its descriptors (in machine learning parlance, it is also referred to as the feature vector).Depending on the problem under study and the accuracy requirements of the predictions, the fingerprint can be defined at varying levels of granularity. For instance, if the goal is to obtain a high-level understanding of the factors underlying a complex phenomenon—such as the mechanical or electrical strength of materials, catalytic activity, etc.—and prediction accuracy is less critical, then the fingerprint may be defined at a gross level, e.g., in terms of the general attributes of the atoms the material is made up of, other potentially relevant properties (e.g., the band gap) or higher-level structural features (e.g., typical grain size). On the other hand, if the goal is to predict specific properties at a reasonable level of accuracy across a wide materials chemical space—such as the dielectric constant of an insulator or the glass transition temperature of a polymer—the fingerprint may have to include information pertaining to key atomic-level structural fragments that may control these properties. If extreme (chemical) accuracy in predictions is demanded—such as total energies and atomic forces, precise identification of structural features, space groups or phases—the fingerprint has to be fine enough so that it is able to encode details of atomic-level structural information with sub-Angstrom-scale resolution. Several examples of learning based on this hierarchy of fingerprints or descriptors are provided in subsequent Sections.The general rule of thumb is that finer the fingerprint, greater is the expected accuracy, and more laborious, more data-intensive and less conceptual is the learning framework. A corollary to the last point is that rapid coarse-level initial screening of materials should generally be targeted using coarser fingerprints.Regardless of the specific choice of representation, the fingerprints should also be invariant to certain transformations. Consider the facial recognition scenario. The numerical representation of a face should not depend on the actual placement location of the face in an image, nor should it matter whether the face has been rotated or enlarged with respect to the examples the machine has seen before. Likewise, the representation of a material should be invariant to the rigid translation or rotation of the material. If the representation is fine enough that it includes atomic position information, permutation of like atoms should not alter the fingerprint. These invariance properties are easy to incorporate in coarser fingerprint definitions but non-trivial in fine-level descriptors. Furthermore, ensuring that a fingerprint contains all the relevant components (and only the relevant components) for a given problem requires careful analysis, for example, using unsupervised learning algorithms.Two historic efforts in which gross-level descriptors were utilized to create surrogate models (although they were not couched under those terms) have lead to the Hume–Rothery rulesTo identify potential nonlinear multivariate relationships efficiently, one may start from a moderate number of potentially relevant primary descriptors (e.g., electronegativity, Building phenomenological models for the prediction of the intrinsic electrical breakdown field of insulators. 
                     One such approach—based on the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)—was recently demonstrated to be highly effective for determining key physical factors that control a complex phenomenon through identification of simple empirical relationships.The phenomenological model was later employed to systematically screen and identify perovskite compounds with high breakdown strength. The purely machine learning based screening revealed that boron-containing compounds are of particular interest, some of which were predicted to exhibit remarkable intrinsic breakdown strength of ~1 GV/m (see Fig. The LASSO-based and related schemes have also been shown to be enormously effective at predicting the preferred crystal structures of materials. In a pioneering study that utilized the LASSO-based approach, Ghiringelli and co-workers were able to classify binary octet insulators into tendencies for the formation of rock salt versus zinc blende structures.Yet another application of the gross-level descriptors relate to the prediction of the band gap of insulators.Other successful attempts of using gross-level descriptors include the creation of surrogate models for the estimation of formation enthalpies,Emerging materials informatics tools also offer tremendous potential and new avenues for mining for structure-property-processing linkages from aggregated and curated materials data sets.The next in the hierarchy of descriptor types are those that encode finer details than those captured by the gross-level properties. Within this class, materials are described in terms of the basic building blocks they are made of. The origins of “block-level” or “molecular fragment” based descriptors can be traced back to cheminformatics, which is a field of theoretical chemistry that deals with correlating properties such as biological activity, physio-chemical properties and reactivity with molecular structure and fragments,Within materials science, specifically, within polymer science, the notions underlying QSAR/QSPR ultimately led to the successful group contribution methods.Modern data-driven methods have significantly improved on these earlier ideas with regards to both issues mentioned above. Recently, in order to enable the accelerated discovery of polymer dielectrics,Learning polymer properties using fragment-level fingerprints. 
                     The molecular fragment-based representation is not restricted to polymeric materials. Novel compositions of AWe now turn to representing materials at the finest possible scale, such that the fingerprint captures precise details of atomic configurations with high fidelity. Such a representation is useful in many scenarios. For instance, one may attempt to connect this fine-scale fingerprint directly with the corresponding total potential energy with chemical accuracy, or with structural phases/motifs (e.g., crystal structure or the presence/absence of a stacking fault). The former capability can lead to purely data-driven accelerated atomistic computational methods, and the latter to refined and efficient on-the-fly characterization schemes.“Chemical accuracy” specifically refers to potential energy and reaction enthalpy predictions with errors of < 1 kcal/mol, and atomic force predictions (the input quantity for molecular dynamics, or MD, simulations) with errors of < 0.05 eV/Å. Chemical accuracy is key to enable reliable MD simulations (or for precise identification of the appropriate structural phases or motifs), and is only possible with fine-level fingerprints that offer sufficiently high configurational resolution, more than those in the examples encountered thus far.The last decade has seen spectacular activity and successes in the general area of data-driven atomistic computations. All modern atomistic computations use either some form of quantum mechanical scheme (e.g., DFT) or a suitably parameterized semi-empirical method to predict the properties of materials, given just the atomic configuration. Quantum mechanical methods are versatile, i.e., they can be used to study any material, in principle. However, they are computationally demanding, as complex differential equations governing the behavior of electrons are solved for every given atomic configuration. Systems involving at most about 1000 atoms can be simulated routinely in a practical setting today. In contrast, semi-empirical methods use prior knowledge about interatomic interactions under known conditions and utilize parameterized analytical equations to determine properties such as the total potential energies, atomic forces, etc. These semi-empirical force fields are several orders of magnitude faster than quantum mechanical methods, and are the choice today for routinely simulating systems containing millions to billions of atoms, as well as the dynamical evolution of systems at nonzero temperatures (using the MD method) at timescales of nanoseconds to milliseconds. However, a major drawback of traditional semi-empirical force fields is that they lack versatility, i.e., they are not transferable to situations or materials for which the original functional forms and parameterizations do not apply.Machine learning is rapidly bridging the chasm between the two extremes of quantum mechanical and semi-empirical methods, and has offered surrogate models that combine the best of both worlds. Rather than resort to specific functional forms and parameterizations adopted in semi-empirical methods (the aspects that restrict their versatility), machine learning methods use an {atomic configuration → property} data set, carefully prepared, e.g., using DFT, to make interpolative predictions of the property of a new configuration at speeds several orders of magnitude faster than DFT. Any material for which adequate reference DFT computations may be performed ahead of time can be handled using such a machine learning scheme. Thus, the lack of versatility issue of traditional semi-empirical approach and the time-intensive nature of quantum mechanical calculations are simultaneously addressed, while also preserving quantum mechanical and chemical accuracy.The primary challenge though has been the creation of suitable fine-level fingerprinting schemes for materials, as these fingerprints are required to be strictly invariant with respect to arbitrary translations, rotations, and exchange of like atoms, in addition to being continuous and differentiable (i.e., “smooth”) with respect to small variations in atomic positions. Several candidates, including those based on symmetry functions,Learning from fine-level fingerprints. 
                     Figure A new development within the area of machine learning force fields is to learn and predict the atomic forces directly;Another notable application of fine-level fingerprints has been in the use of the electronic charge density itself as the representation to learn various propertiesFine-level fingerprints have also been used to characterize structure in various settings. Within a general crystallographic structure refinement problem, one has to estimate the structural parameters of a system, i.e., the unit cell parameters (a, b, c, Unsupervised learning using fine-level fingerprints (and clustering based on these fingerprints) has led to the classification of materials based on their phases or structural characteristics.Given that machine learning predictions are inherently statistical in nature, uncertainties must be expected in the predictions. Moreover, predictions are typically and ideally interpolative between data points corresponding to previously seen data. To what extent a new case for which a prediction needs to be made falls in or out of the domain of the original data set (i.e., to what extent the predictions are interpolative or extrapolative) may be quantified using the predicted uncertainty. While strategies are available to prescribe prediction uncertainties, these ideas have been explored only to a limited extent within materials science.Uncertainty quantification has a second important benefit. It can be used to continuously and progressively improve a prediction model, i.e., render it a truly learning model. Ideally, the learning model should adaptively and iteratively improve by asking questions such as 
                                       
                        Some of the first examples of using adaptive design for targeted materials discovery include identification of shape memory alloys with low thermal hysteresisThe materials science community is just beginning to explore and utilize the plethora of available information theoretic algorithms to mine and learn from data. The usage of an algorithm is driven largely by need, as it should. One such need is to be able to learn and predict vectorial quantities. Examples include functions, such as the electronic or vibrational density of states (which are functions of energy or frequency). Although, the target property in these cases may be viewed as a set of scalar quantities at each energy or frequency (for a given structure) to be learned and predicted independently, it is desirable to learn and predict the entire function simultaneously. This is because the value of the function at a particular energy or frequency is correlated to the function values at other energy or frequency values. Properly learning the function of interest requires machine learning algorithms that can handle vectorial outputs. Such algorithms are indeed available,Another algorithm that is beginning to show value within material science falls under multi-fidelity learning.Finally, machine learning algorithms may also lead to strategies for making the so-called “inverse design” of materials possible. Inverse design refers to the paradigm whereby one seeks to identify materials that satisfy a target set of desired properties (in this parlance, the “forward” process refers to predicting the properties of a given material).Perhaps the most important question that plagues new researchers eager to use data-driven methods is whether their problem lends itself to such methods. Needless to say, the existence of past reliable data, or efforts devoted to its generation for at least a subset of the critical cases in a uniform and controlled manner, is a prerequisite for the adoption of machine learning. Even so, the question is the appropriateness of machine learning for the problem at hand. Ideally, data-driven methods should be aimed at (1) properties very difficult or expensive to compute or measure using traditional methods, (2) phenomena that are complex enough (or nondeterministic) that there is no hope for a direct solution based on solving fundamental equations, or (3) phenomena whose governing equations are not (yet) known, providing a rationale for the creation of surrogate models. Such scenarios are replete in the social, cognitive and biological sciences, explaining the pervasive applications of data-driven methods in such domains. Materials science examples ideal for studies using machine learning methods include properties such as the glass transition temperature of polymers, dielectric loss of polycrystalline materials over a wide frequency and temperature range, mechanical strength of composites, failure time of engineering materials (e.g., due to electrical, mechanical or thermal stresses), friction coefficient of materials, etc., all of which involve the inherent complexity of materials, i.e., their polycrystalline or amorphous nature, multi-scale geometric architectures, the presence of defects of various scales and types, and so on.Machine learning may also be used to eliminate redundancies underlying repetitive but expensive operations, especially when interpolations in high-dimensional spaces are required, such as when properties across enormous chemical and/or configurational spaces are desired. An example of the latter scenario, i.e., an immense configurational space, is encountered in first principles molecular dynamics simulations, when atomic forces are evaluated repetitively (using expensive quantum mechanical schemes) for myriads of very similar atomic configurations. The area of machine learning force fields has burgeoned to meet this need. Yet another setting where large chemical and configurational spaces are encountered is the emerging domain of high-throughput materials characterization, where on-the-fly predictions are required to avoid data accumulation bottlenecks. Although materials informatics efforts so far have largely focused on model problems and the validation of the general notion of data-driven discovery, active efforts are beginning to emerge that focus on complex real-world materials applications, strategies to handle situations inaccessible to traditional materials computations, and the creation of adaptive prediction frameworks (through adequate uncertainty quantification) that build efficiencies within rational materials design efforts.

      www.nist.gov/programs-projects/materials-informatics The Materials Genome Initiative will create a new era of materials innovation that will serve as a foundation for strengthening domestic industries in these fields. This initiative offers a unique opportunity for the United States to discover, develop, manufacture, and deploy advanced materials at least twice as fast as possible today, at a fraction of the cost. Essential to this effort is the development of a data infrastructure that will provide the needed data and tools to support this effort. Some of the fundamental data needed for this infrastructure is phase based material data.   Phase-based data includes thermodynamics, diffusion, molar volume, elastic properties, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity and may be extended to two phase descriptions such as interfacial energies. Phase-based data includes both experimental and computational data. One of the biggest challenges is addressing the multicomponent nature of phase-based data. Another challenge is that the different users of the data have different needs.  For example, an industrial user user may just want a number (i.e. the diffusion coefficient for specific material). While an expert in the field may want all the available raw data (i.e. expert in diffusion may want not only the report diffusion coefficients and reported composition profiles, but also the SIMS intensity vs distance data (if SIMS was used to collect the diffusion data.) This requires that data infrastructure be built to accommodate a variety of user needs and as well as data types.To develop the need data infrastructure and informatics tools, NIST is focusing on three areas: data curation, data infrastructure, and data access.      presentation from 2nd World Congress on ICME, Salt Lake City, July 9, 2013. Alden Dima, ITL Software and Systems DivisionThermodynamics Research Center (   This project supports NIST's efforts in the Laura Bartolo, Northwestern University/CHiMaD

This course aims to provide a succinct overview of the emerging discipline of Materials Informatics at the intersection of materials science, computational science, and information science. Attention is drawn to specific opportunities afforded by this new field in accelerating materials development and deployment efforts. A particular emphasis is placed on materials exhibiting hierarchical internal structures spanning multiple length/structure scales and the impediments involved in establishing invertible process-structure-property (PSP) linkages for these materials. More specifically, it is argued that modern data sciences (including advanced statistics, dimensionality reduction, and formulation of metamodels) and innovative cyberinfrastructure tools (including integration platforms, databases, and customized tools for enhancement of collaborations among cross-disciplinary team members) are likely to play a critical and pivotal role in addressing the above challenges.When will I have access to the lectures and assignments?What if I need additional time to complete the course?What will I get if I pay for this course?Can I take this course for free?What is the refund policy?Is financial aid available?Each course is like an interactive textbook, featuring pre-recorded videos, quizzes and projects.Connect with thousands of other learners and debate ideas, discuss course material,
      and get help mastering concepts.Earn official recognition for your work, and share your success with friends,
      colleagues, and employers.mgits easy to do itBWGreat introduction of the why and how of materials informatics!A great introductory course into Material Data Sciences and Informatics. Had a relatively hard time when the course turned form introduction into hardcore statistics. Moreover, it can be more helpful if there are more practical projects and tutorial on introduced tools.Very valuable course for materials modelling enthusiast. It provides me the firm grounding and preparation for my future research work in this material modeling. This course is a fine balance of technical knowledge, its implementation and the practical approaches one needs to adopt to effectively use this knowledge of materials modeling in real world.
